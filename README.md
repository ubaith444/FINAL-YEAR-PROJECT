AI-Enabled Intelligent Teacher Robot for Automated Attendance, Personalized Learning Assistance, and Real-Time Knowledge Retrieval

Project Overview
The proposed project aims to develop an AI-enabled intelligent teacher robot that assists in classroom management and student learning. The system is designed to automate attendance marking, provide interactive learning support, and retrieve educational information in real time.
The robot functions as a teaching assistant rather than a replacement for teachers. It helps reduce manual workload and improves classroom efficiency through automation and intelligent interaction.

Working Principle
The system uses computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize students and mark attendance automatically. It also supports voice-based interaction, allowing students to ask questions. The system processes the query using natural language processing and retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base.
The overall system combines:
Face recognition for attendance
Speech recognition for interaction
Natural language processing for understanding queries
Knowledge retrieval for answering questions

Main Components
Camera Module – Captures student images for attendance.
Face Recognition Module – Identifies students and updates attendance records.
Microphone Module – Captures student voice input.
Speech-to-Text Module – Converts voice queries into text.
NLP Module – Analyzes and understands student questions.
Knowledge Retrieval Module – Fetches relevant answers from the database.
Output Module – Provides response via speaker or display.
Database – Stores attendance and interaction data securely.

Expected Outcome
Automated and accurate attendance marking
Reduced teacher workload
Improved student engagement
Faster access to learning materials
Smart classroom assistance system
